                    developing the general theory of relativity and the formula E=MC<sup>2</sup>, which related mass and
                    energy - and led to the discovery of atomic energy.</p>

            <p class="footer">"Einstein’s researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include Special Theory
                of Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General Theory of Relativity
                (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among
                his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My
                Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important."</p>
